# LinkedIn Post - Elasticsearch Agent Builder Hackathon

---

🚀 Just submitted **JurisScope** to the Elasticsearch Agent Builder Hackathon!

We built an AI-powered legal research workbench that combines multi-step reasoning with Elasticsearch's hybrid search to help legal teams analyze complex case documents, regulations, and internal communications.

**What makes it different:**
- Multi-agent orchestration using Elasticsearch Agent Builder
- Hybrid search (BM25 + vector) across 16 document types
- Intelligent citation tracking with precise snippet references
- Structured data extraction for compliance analysis

Instead of single-prompt answers, JurisScope agents reason across multiple documents, retrieve relevant context, and execute tasks like GDPR compliance checks or bias audits — all backed by Elasticsearch's speed and scale.

Built in 5 weeks for the @Elastic Agent Builder Hackathon. Competing for $20,000 in prizes alongside 2,100+ developers worldwide.

Check out the demo case: DataSure vs TechNova — a fictional AI hiring bias lawsuit involving GDPR violations and EU AI Act compliance.

**Tech stack:**
- Elasticsearch 8.11 (serverless)
- Agent Builder framework
- Next.js 15 + FastAPI
- ES|QL for structured queries
- Hybrid search + reranking

Huge thanks to the Elastic team for building such a powerful agent framework. Excited to see where this goes!
