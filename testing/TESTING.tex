\textbf{Case:} DataSure vs TechNova --- AI hiring bias, GDPR \& EU AI
Act compliance \textbf{Documents loaded:} 16 files across regulations,
internal docs, legal correspondence, case summaries \& communications

\begin{center}\rule{0.5\linewidth}{0.5pt}\end{center}

\subsection{Case Overview}\label{case-overview}

TechNova, a Berlin-based AI startup, developed \textbf{InsightPredict}
--- an AI hiring and performance prediction platform deployed to 127
client organisations covering \textasciitilde450,000 employees and
candidates across the EU. Internal testing (July--August 2024) and an
independent investigation by DataSure, a Brussels-based advocacy group,
found statistically significant bias:

African/Middle Eastern names & −5.8 pts & −3 to −6 pts \\
Asian names & −2.3 pts & Corroborated \\
Eastern European names & −3.1 pts & Corroborated \\
\end{longtable}
}

DataSure threatened regulatory complaints in 5 jurisdictions unless
TechNova settled. Settlement negotiations are underway (cap: €12M).
Potential regulatory exposure: €50--100M+.

\begin{quote}
\textbf{Tip:} After each answer, hover over citation numbers
\textbf{{[}1{]}}, \textbf{{[}2{]}} etc. to see the exact source snippet.

\subsection{Tips for Best Results}\label{tips-for-best-results}

\textbf{Good Discover questions:} - Specific and grounded:
\texttt{"What\ does\ Article\ 10\ of\ the\ AI\ Act\ require\ about\ training\ data\ examination?"}
- Cross-reference:
\texttt{"How\ do\ internal\ emails\ contradict\ TechNova\textquotesingle{}s\ public\ statements?"}
- Request synthesis:
\texttt{"Compare\ the\ bias\ numbers\ in\ DataSure\textquotesingle{}s\ report\ versus\ TechNova\textquotesingle{}s\ internal\ findings"}

\textbf{Questions that may struggle:} - Too broad:
\texttt{"Tell\ me\ everything\ about\ GDPR"} - Outside the documents:
\texttt{"What\ happened\ after\ October\ 2024?"} - Requires external
data: \texttt{"What\ is\ the\ current\ AI\ Act\ enforcement\ status?"}

\textbf{Good Table columns:} - Ask for a single, clear attribute per
column - Use consistent value types (dates as dates, ratings as labels,
lists as comma-separated) - For numeric columns, specify the unit or
scale expected

\end{document}
