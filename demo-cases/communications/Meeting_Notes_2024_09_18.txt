================================================================================
1. MEETING OPENING (14:00)
================================================================================

JENNIFER HARTLEY:
Good afternoon everyone. Thank you all for making time on short notice. I know
we've had several emergency meetings over the past month since Sofia discovered
the bias issues, but today's meeting is particularly critical.

As you all know, we received a formal complaint letter from DataSure on September
5th. They're threatening to file complaints with market surveillance authorities
and data protection authorities in five jurisdictions, support class action
litigation, and launch a public campaign.

Their allegations are serious and, based on our internal investigation, largely
accurate. We have bias in our models, gaps in our AI Act compliance, and
potential GDPR violations.

We need to make some strategic decisions today about how to respond. I've asked
our external counsel to join us to help us think through the options.

Before we dive in, I want to set some ground rules:
1. This meeting is attorney-client privileged. No notes leave this room without
   legal review.
2. We will be completely honest with each other about the severity of the problems.
3. We focus on solutions, not blame.
4. All decisions today are preliminary - we may need Board approval for some
   items.

Rebecca will take minutes for legal purposes. Any questions before we begin?

[No questions]

Okay. Sarah, can you give us the legal overview?

================================================================================
2. LEGAL OVERVIEW (14:05)
================================================================================

SARAH MITCHELL:
Thanks Jennifer. I'll keep this high-level since we have external counsel on
the call who will dive deeper.

Current situation:
- DataSure has

 conducted independent testing showing gender and age bias in our
  candidate scoring and performance prediction models
- Their findings align with Sofia's internal testing from August
- They claim to have internal TechNova documents, though we don't know the source
- They've given us until October 1st to engage in settlement discussions, or
  they'll proceed with regulatory complaints

Legal exposure falls into four categories:

1. REGULATORY - AI ACT:
   - Article 9 (Risk Management) violations
   - Article 10 (Data Governance) violations
   - Article 14 (Human Oversight) potential violations
   - Penalty exposure: €8-15M

2. REGULATORY - GDPR:
   - Article 5(1)(a) (Fairness) violations
   - Article 9 (Special Categories) potential violations
   - Penalty exposure: €4-8M

3. CIVIL LIABILITY:
   - Employment discrimination claims by affected individuals
   - Could be class actions or representative actions
   - Potential exposure: €20-60M (very rough estimate)

4. CONTRACTUAL LIABILITY:
   - Breach of warranty to clients (we warranted compliance and non-discrimination)
   - Indemnification obligations if clients are sued
   - Potential exposure: €30-80M (overlaps with civil liability)

Combined total exposure: €50-100M+ in a worst-case scenario.

That said, this is worst-case. With proper strategy, we can likely reduce this
significantly.

I'll turn it over to Dr. Bauer for AI Act analysis, then Caroline for GDPR.

================================================================================
3. AI ACT ANALYSIS (14:15)
================================================================================

DR. FRIEDRICH BAUER (External Counsel):
Thank you, Sarah. Good afternoon everyone.

I've reviewed your internal compliance assessment and the DataSure allegations.
Let me be direct: you have serious AI Act compliance gaps. However, the AI Act
is new, enforcement precedent is limited, and authorities may be more lenient
with early violations where you show good faith remediation.

ARTICLE 9 - RISK MANAGEMENT SYSTEM:

The requirement is clear: you must have a continuous risk management system
addressing risks to fundamental rights, health, and safety.

Your gaps:
- Bias risk assessment was inadequate - you didn't identify the gender/age bias
  until external testing
- Fundamental Rights Impact Assessment not conducted
- Risk mitigation measures insufficient

However, you do have some risk management processes in place - they were just
inadequate. This is a "quality" failure more than a "complete absence" failure.
That distinction may matter for penalty severity.

ARTICLE 10 - DATA GOVERNANCE:

This is your most serious exposure. The article requires training data to be
"appropriate," "representative," and examined for "possible biases."

Your training data includes historical performance evaluations from periods with
documented discrimination. Using biased labels to train predictive models violates
Article 10's fundamental purpose.

This will be difficult to defend. The violation is clear and directly led to
discriminatory outcomes.

ARTICLE 14 - HUMAN OVERSIGHT:

More arguable. You do have humans in the loop - HR professionals make final
decisions. However, if the 78% correlation between recommendations and decisions
indicates automation bias, regulators may find oversight inadequate.

This is probably your strongest defense area. Emphasize:
- Humans make all final decisions
- System provides recommendations, not determinations
- Training materials emphasize human judgment
- Some correlation is expected if system provides valuable insights

ENFORCEMENT LIKELIHOOD AND STRATEGY:

If DataSure files complaints, I estimate:
- 80% chance of Article 10 enforcement action
- 70% chance of Article 9 enforcement action
- 40% chance of Article 14 enforcement action

Strategy options:

OPTION A - Aggressive Defense:
Fight the allegations, deny violations, force authorities to prove case.
Pros: Delay, uncertainty may lead authorities to accept settlement
Cons: High legal costs, bad faith appearance, likely lose anyway, higher penalties

OPTION B - Negotiated Settlement with Authorities:
Proactively engage market surveillance authorities, admit gaps, propose remediation.
Pros: Good faith credit, potentially lower penalties, controlled timeline
Cons: Admission of violations, still face penalties

OPTION C - Settlement with DataSure + Regulatory Engagement:
Settle with DataSure (financial payment + compliance commitments), then engage
authorities showing settlement as evidence of good faith.
Pros: Removes public campaign threat, shows responsibility, may satisfy authorities
Cons: Expensive, DataSure may demand too much, authorities still independent

My recommendation: OPTION C - Settlement with DataSure + Regulatory Engagement

This gives you maximum control and best chance of minimizing total damage.

DR. MICHAEL ZHANG:
Dr. Bauer, you mentioned the Article 10 violation is our most serious exposure.
If we completely retrain our models on debiased data, does that mitigate the
violation retroactively?

DR. FRIEDRICH BAUER:
Good question. Retraining helps prospectively - it prevents future violations.
But it doesn't eliminate liability for past violations. However, it does
demonstrate good faith and commitment to compliance, which authorities will
consider in penalty calculations.

Think of it like environmental violations - if a factory polluted in the past,
installing new clean technology doesn't erase the past pollution, but it shows
responsibility and reduces penalties.

JENNIFER HARTLEY:
What kind of penalty reduction might we see with good faith remediation?

DR. FRIEDRICH BAUER:
Purely speculative, but based on GDPR enforcement patterns (which may be analogous):
- Aggressive defense: €10-15M AI Act penalties
- Remediation + cooperation: €3-8M AI Act penalties

50-70% reduction is plausible with genuine cooperation and remediation.

================================================================================
4. GDPR ANALYSIS (14:35)
================================================================================

CAROLINE MOORE (External Counsel):
Thank you. I'll be brief since much of the analysis parallels the AI Act issues.

ARTICLE 5(1)(A) - FAIRNESS PRINCIPLE:

This is a foundational GDPR principle. Processing must be "lawful, fair and
transparent."

The EDPB has made clear that fairness encompasses non-discrimination. Your
systematic bias in algorithmic processing almost certainly violates the fairness
principle.

This violation is ongoing - every biased prediction is a new fairness violation.

ARTICLE 9 - SPECIAL CATEGORIES:

If your system processes biometric data (facial recognition, voice analysis) or
makes inferences about gender/age/ethnicity, you need an Article 9(2) legal basis.

Your current legal basis (employment law necessity under Article 9(2)(b)) may be
adequate for some processing, but you should audit this carefully.

The inference of protected characteristics (gender, age, ethnicity) from names
and other data is legally complex. This is an emerging area of GDPR law. Some
authorities consider inference to trigger Article 9; others don't. You have
compliance risk here.

ARTICLE 22 - AUTOMATED DECISION-MAKING:

I disagree slightly with Dr. Bauer here. I think your Article 22 risk is higher
than he suggested.

Article 22 prohibits "solely automated" decisions with significant effects.
You argue there's human involvement. But if that involvement is nominal due to
automation bias, authorities may find it's "solely automated" in substance if
not form.

The Article 29 Working Party (now EDPB) has said human involvement must be
"meaningful" not merely "token." 78% correlation plus limited explainability
suggests humans are rubber-stamping more than truly deciding.

This is a vulnerable point legally.

ENFORCEMENT STRATEGY:

DPAs tend to be more aggressive than market surveillance authorities. They have
more experience, more resources, and less tolerance for fundamental rights
violations.

If DataSure files GDPR complaints, I'd estimate:
- 85% chance of Article 5(1)(a) enforcement
- 60% chance of Article 9 investigation (lower because legally complex)
- 50% chance of Article 22 enforcement

Lead supervisory authority will likely be Berlin DPA (Berliner Beauftragte für
Datenschutz und Informationsfreiheit) since you're headquartered here. However,
other DPAs may also investigate if they claim local jurisdiction.

My strategic recommendation aligns with Dr. Bauer: Proactive settlement and
engagement is your best path.

One additional consideration: You may want to conduct voluntary Data Protection
Impact Assessment update and share with DPA showing you're taking this seriously.

DAVID CHEN:
Caroline, we did conduct a DPIA back in 2022. Does updating it now help, given
that it's after we discovered the problems?

CAROLINE MOORE:
Yes, absolutely. Article 35 requires DPIAs to be living documents. Updating it
now shows:
1. You take compliance seriously
2. You respond to new information
3. You're assessing and mitigating risks

Better late than never. I'd recommend commissioning an independent DPIA from
external consultant for credibility.

================================================================================
5. TECHNICAL REMEDIATION UPDATE (14:50)
================================================================================

JENNIFER HARTLEY:
Thank you, Caroline and Friedrich. Very helpful, if sobering.

Michael, can you update us on the technical remediation work?

DR. MICHAEL ZHANG:
Yes. We've made significant progress since August.

IMMEDIATE FIXES (COMPLETED):
1. Deployed fairness-constrained model version on September 1st
   - Reduces gender bias from 7.1 points to 2.1 points
   - Reduces ethnic bias by similar proportions
   - Cost: 3% reduction in overall accuracy (F1 score 0.78 to 0.75)

2. Implemented name-stripping in NLP preprocessing
   - Names removed before BERT processing
   - Eliminates most direct name-based bias
   - Some residual bias from writing style still present

3. Enhanced monitoring and alerting
   - Disaggregated performance metrics by demographic groups
   - Automated bias alerts if fairness thresholds exceeded
   - Weekly bias audit reports

RESULTS SO FAR:
Production data from September 1-15 shows:
- Gender score gap reduced to 2.3 points (down from 7.1)
- Age-related bias reduced but not eliminated
- Ethnic bias reduced to 1.5-2.5 points (down from 3-6 points)

This is better, but not perfect. We still have work to do.

SHORT-TERM WORK (NEXT 60 DAYS):
1. Training data debiasing
   - Remove/relabel historical data from periods with documented discrimination
   - Augment with synthetic balanced data
   - Sofia leading this, about 40% complete

2. Model retraining
   - Complete retraining on debiased data
   - Enhanced fairness constraints
   - Target: Gender/ethnic bias under 1.0 point, age bias eliminated
   - Expected completion: Early November

3. Enhanced explainability
   - Improved SHAP explanations
   - Counterfactual generation
   - Uncertainty quantification
   - About 30% complete

LONG-TERM (3-6 MONTHS):
1. Comprehensive model architecture redesign
2. Fairness-by-design principles from ground up
3. Regular third-party bias audits
4. Continuous bias monitoring and correction

SOFIA RODRIGUEZ:
Can I add something?

JENNIFER HARTLEY:
Of course.

SOFIA RODRIGUEZ:
The technical fixes will help a lot, but we need to be realistic about limitations.

Perfect fairness is mathematically impossible - there are trade-offs between
different fairness definitions. We can optimize for demographic parity (same
selection rates), or equalized odds (same accuracy rates), or calibration
(same meaning of scores), but not all simultaneously.

Additionally, some bias may persist because it's embedded in the historical
patterns we're trying to predict. If the historical data shows that certain
groups had lower performance ratings (even unfairly), and we're trying to predict
future ratings, the model will learn those patterns.

We can get much better than we are now. But we can't get to zero bias unless
we completely abandon predictive modeling, which would defeat the purpose of
the product.

I think we can get to a point where bias is minimal and within acceptable bounds,
but we need to be honest with clients and regulators about residual limitations.

DR. ELENA KOVÁCS:
I agree with Sofia. This is exactly why Article 14 requires human oversight -
because AI systems can't be perfect. The humans are supposed to catch the edge
cases and errors.

The question is whether we've designed our system to enable effective human
oversight, which brings us back to the Article 14 question.

JENNIFER HARTLEY:
That's a good segue. Elena, can you talk about the human oversight improvements?

DR. ELENA KOVÁCS:
Yes. We've been working on this parallel to the technical bias fixes.

HUMAN OVERSIGHT ENHANCEMENTS:
1. Redesigned user interface
   - Predictions now clearly labeled as "recommendations" not "scores"
   - Prominent display of confidence intervals and uncertainty
   - Warning messages for low-confidence predictions
   - Easy override buttons with no penalties for overriding

2. Enhanced training for deployers
   - New training modules on automation bias
   - Case studies of when to override algorithms
   - Explanation of fairness considerations
   - Certification requirement for HR users

3. Decision support tools
   - Structured decision checklists
   - Requirement to document reasoning when following recommendations
   - Flagging of decisions that exactly match algorithm without documented
     independent reasoning

4. Monitoring oversight effectiveness
   - Tracking override rates (currently 12%, up from 3.2% before changes)
   - Logging time spent reviewing recommendations
   - Surveys of HR users about confidence in their independent judgment

EARLY RESULTS:
Since implementing these changes on September 10th:
- Override/adjustment rate up to 12% (good - shows more independent thinking)
- User feedback positive - they feel more empowered to disagree with algorithm
- Correlation between recommendations and decisions down to 68% (from 78%)

This suggests human oversight is becoming more meaningful, not just rubber-stamping.

MARCUS THOMPSON:
One thing to add: these changes have some business impact. Clients are processing
decisions more slowly (more time for thoughtful review), and some clients are
complaining that the system is "less useful" if they can't trust the recommendations.

We've had two clients ask to turn off the new warning messages because they find
them annoying.

This is the tension - better oversight and fairness versus ease of use and
efficiency. We're erring on the side of fairness and oversight, but it's costing
us some customer satisfaction.

================================================================================
6. DATASURE SETTLEMENT DISCUSSION (15:10)
================================================================================

JENNIFER HARTLEY:
Okay, thank you everyone for the technical and legal updates. Now let's talk
strategy.

We have basically three options:

A) Ignore DataSure, hope they go away or their complaints don't gain traction
B) Fight DataSure, deny everything, aggressive legal defense
C) Engage with DataSure, try to reach settlement

Friedrich and Caroline both recommended Option C. Sarah, David, Elena - what do
you think?

SARAH MITCHELL:
Option C, absolutely. Options A and B are terrible.

If we ignore them, they file complaints and we face enforcement actions plus
public campaign. We look irresponsible.

If we fight them, we'll probably lose because they're largely correct, and we
spend millions on legal fees only to end up in worse position.

Option C gives us control. We negotiate settlement terms, get their agreement
not to file complaints or support litigation, and we demonstrate to regulators
that we took responsibility.

DAVID CHEN:
Agreed. From compliance perspective, Option C lets us get ahead of the regulators
rather than reacting defensively.

My concern with Option C is: what if DataSure demands too much? What's our walk-
away point?

JENNIFER HARTLEY:
Good question. Sarah, what do you think DataSure wants?

SARAH MITCHELL:
Based on their letter and their history with other companies:

1. INSTITUTIONAL REFORM (This is their primary goal - they're advocates, not
   profit-seekers)
   - Binding compliance commitments
   - Independent monitoring
   - Transparency reporting
   - Algorithmic audits

2. AFFECTED INDIVIDUAL COMPENSATION
   - Fund for people harmed by biased recommendations
   - Probably €5-10M

3. FINANCIAL PAYMENT TO DATASURE
   - For their advocacy work and costs
   - Probably €2-3M

4. TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY
   - Public acknowledgment
   - Disclosure of bias testing results
   - Academic research access to data

Total cost: €7-13M plus compliance program costs (which we should do anyway).

Compare that to:
- Regulatory penalties: €12-23M (without cooperation credit)
- Civil litigation: €20-60M
- Reputational damage: incalculable but huge

Settlement is cheaper than fighting, even if it's painful.

REBECCA ZHANG (Legal Counsel):
One thing to consider: Does settling with DataSure prevent regulatory action?

No. Authorities are independent. But it helps demonstrate good faith.

Also, does settling with DataSure prevent civil litigation by affected individuals?

No. We can't bind third parties. But DataSure has agreed in similar settlements
not to actively support or fund litigation, which removes a major threat.

DR. FRIEDRICH BAUER:
Rebecca is correct. Settlement with DataSure is not immunity, but it's risk
mitigation.

Think of it as buying peace with your most sophisticated and dangerous adversary.
They have the technical capability to expose your issues, the legal knowledge to
file effective complaints, and the media savvy to damage your reputation.

Settling with them removes those threats and converts them from adversary to
neutral party, or even cautious ally if you genuinely commit to reform.

JENNIFER HARTLEY:
Okay, I'm hearing consensus for Option C - engage settlement negotiations.

Walk-away terms: What's our maximum we're willing to pay?

MARCUS THOMPSON:
From business perspective, we can afford €10-15M total. Beyond that we're looking
at layoffs, cutting R&D, potentially affecting business viability.

JENNIFER HARTLEY:
Sarah, what's your view on acceptable settlement structure?

SARAH MITCHELL:
Maximum commitment: €12M total
- €7M compensation fund for affected individuals
- €3M payment to DataSure
- €2M for independent monitoring and audits (3 years)

We should be willing to agree to:
- Binding compliance commitments (we're doing this anyway)
- Independent monitoring (actually helps us - shows good faith to regulators)
- Transparency reporting (limited to protect proprietary info)
- Regular bias audits (we should do this anyway)

We should NOT agree to:
- Admitting legal liability (frame as "acknowledging need for improvement")
- Unrestricted access to proprietary algorithms
- Permanent ongoing monitoring (3 years maximum)
- Agreements that would violate client confidentiality

JENNIFER HARTLEY:
Okay. Proposal: We authorize Sarah to engage settlement negotiations with DataSure.
Authority to settle up to €12M with terms discussed, subject to final my approval
and Board notification.

Any objections?

[No objections]

Alright, Sarah, please reach out to DataSure and propose mediation. Let's aim
to have settlement in principle by mid-October.

================================================================================
7. CLIENT COMMUNICATION STRATEGY (15:35)
================================================================================

JENNIFER HARTLEY:
Next topic: our 127 clients. They need to know what's happening.

Elena, you drafted a client communication. Can you summarize?

DR. ELENA KOVÁCS:
Yes. I propose three-tier communication strategy:

TIER 1 - TOP 20 CLIENTS (representing 60% of revenue):
- Direct phone calls from me or Marcus
- In-person meetings if requested
- Full transparency about issues and remediation
- Offer: Free bias audit of their historical decisions, remediation support
- Timeline: This week

TIER 2 - NEXT 50 CLIENTS:
- Personalized emails from account managers
- Webinar explaining situation and remediation
- Written summary of changes and improvements
- Offer: Discounted bias audit service
- Timeline: Next week

TIER 3 - REMAINING 57 CLIENTS:
- Standard email communication
- Access to self-service resources
- FAQs and documentation
- Timeline: Next week

ALL CLIENTS:
- Transparency report on bias issues and fixes
- Updated technical documentation
- Enhanced training materials
- Commitment to ongoing monitoring and reporting

KEY MESSAGES:
1. We discovered bias issues through internal testing (true, don't mention DataSure
   unless asked)
2. We immediately implemented fixes (true - fairness-constrained model deployed)
3. We're committed to industry-leading fairness and compliance (aspirational but
   genuine)
4. We're offering support to help clients assess any impact (proactive responsibility)

RISKS:
- Some clients will terminate contracts (estimate: 10-15%)
- Some will demand price concessions or free services
- Some may face their own liability if they made decisions based on our biased
  recommendations

MITIGATION:
- Offer contract extensions or pricing concessions to retain clients
- Support them in their own compliance efforts
- Frame this as partnership in continuous improvement

MARCUS THOMPSON:
I'm worried about the financial impact. If we lose 15% of clients plus give
concessions to others, we could see €8-10M annual revenue hit.

JENNIFER HARTLEY:
I understand the concern. But the alternative - them finding out from DataSure
public campaign or regulatory action - would be much worse.

We tell them ourselves, we control the narrative. We show them we're fixing it.
Some will leave, but more will stay if we're transparent and supportive.

DAVID CHEN:
I agree with Jennifer. Also, contractually, we may be obligated to notify them
under our Data Processing Agreements. We warrant compliance - if we're not
compliant, we need to tell them.

SARAH MITCHELL:
David's right. Several of our DPAs have provisions requiring notification of
compliance issues. If we don't notify and they later claim we breached, we're
in worse position.

JENNIFER HARTLEY:
Okay, decision: We proceed with Elena's three-tier communication plan. Elena,
please finalize the materials and we'll start outreach on Monday.

Marcus, work with Finance to model the revenue impact and identify areas we can
cut costs if needed.

================================================================================
8. REGULATORY ENGAGEMENT STRATEGY (15:50)
================================================================================

JENNIFER HARTLEY:
Last major topic: regulatory engagement.

Friedrich, Caroline - should we proactively notify regulators, or wait?

DR. FRIEDRICH BAUER:
My recommendation: Wait until we have settlement with DataSure, then engage
proactively.

Reason: If you engage now, before settlement, you're admitting violations with
DataSure still threatening to file competing complaints. Complicated.

If you engage after settlement, you can say: "We identified issues, we settled
with concerned parties, we've implemented fixes, we're here to discuss any
remaining regulatory concerns."

Much stronger position.

Timeline: Aim to engage with regulators in November, after you hope to have
DataSure settlement finalized.

CAROLINE MOORE:
I agree with Friedrich's approach for AI Act.

For GDPR, slightly different consideration. There's an argument that ongoing
fairness violations create obligation to self-report to DPA.

However, I don't think you have a mandatory reporting obligation under Article 33
(that's for data breaches). This is a compliance gap, not a breach.

So I also recommend waiting until after DataSure settlement, then proactive
engagement with Berlin DPA.

Bring:
- Updated DPIA
- Bias audit reports
- Technical remediation plan
- Settlement agreement (shows responsibility)

Show them you're taking this seriously and seeking guidance on ensuring full
compliance.

DAVID CHEN:
Do we need to notify supervisory authorities about the changes we've made to the
AI system? Like the fairness-constrained model deployment?

DR. FRIEDRICH BAUER:
Under current AI Act provisions, system updates don't require pre-notification.
However, as part of post-market monitoring and continuous compliance, you should
be documenting all changes.

When you eventually undergo conformity assessment, the notified body will review
your change management processes.

JENNIFER HARTLEY:
Okay, so the plan is:
1. Finalize settlement with DataSure (target: mid-October)
2. Complete immediate technical remediations (target: end October)
3. Proactively engage regulators (target: November)
4. Show good faith, cooperation, and commitment to compliance

Does that sound right?

DR. FRIEDRICH BAUER & CAROLINE MOORE:
[Both agreeing]

Yes, that's the right approach.

================================================================================
9. BUDGET AND RESOURCES (16:05)
================================================================================

JENNIFER HARTLEY:
Let's talk about what this is going to cost.

Sarah, what's the total budget we need?

SARAH MITCHELL:
Based on our discussions:

SETTLEMENT:
- DataSure settlement: €12M (maximum)

COMPLIANCE PROGRAM:
- External legal counsel (Friedrich, Caroline): €300-400K
- Technical remediation (internal team): €500K (mostly salaries and compute)
- Independent bias audits (third party): €200K annually x 3 years = €600K
- Updated DPIA and assessments: €100K
- Training materials and programs: €150K
- Monitoring infrastructure: €200K

POTENTIAL REVENUE IMPACT:
- Client churn: €8-10M annual revenue loss
- Pricing concessions: €2-3M annual revenue impact

TOTAL ESTIMATED COST (3 years):
- One-time: €14M (settlement + compliance setup)
- Ongoing: €200K/year (monitoring, audits)
- Revenue impact: €10-13M/year

This is painful but manageable. We're profitable, we have cash reserves, and we
can cut costs in other areas if needed.

MARCUS THOMPSON:
The alternative - regulatory penalties, litigation, reputational damage, potential
business failure - would cost much more.

This is expensive insurance, but necessary.

JENNIFER HARTLEY:
Agreed. I'll present this to the Board next week. I expect they'll approve.

We'll need to cut some expenses:
- Hiring freeze for non-essential roles
- Reduce marketing spend
- Defer some R&D projects
- Cut executive bonuses for this year (starting with me)

But we're not doing layoffs unless absolutely necessary. This wasn't our employees'
fault - it was a leadership and process failure. We fix it and move forward.

================================================================================
10. ACTION ITEMS AND NEXT STEPS (16:15)
================================================================================

JENNIFER HARTLEY:
Let's summarize action items:

SARAH MITCHELL:
- Engage DataSure for settlement mediation (by Friday September 20)
- Coordinate external counsel ongoing support
- Draft Board presentation

MARCUS THOMPSON / DR. MICHAEL ZHANG:
- Complete technical remediation roadmap and timeline
- Oversee model retraining and deployment
- Prepare technical documentation for regulators

DR. ELENA KOVÁCS:
- Finalize client communication materials
- Execute three-tier outreach plan (starting Monday September 23)
- Enhanced human oversight training rollout

DAVID CHEN:
- Commission independent DPIA update
- Comprehensive compliance program proposal
- Regulatory engagement preparation

SOFIA RODRIGUEZ:
- Lead training data debiasing project
- Coordinate bias testing and validation
- Monthly bias audit reports

ALL:
- Maintain attorney-client privilege for sensitive communications
- No external discussions without coordination
- Weekly leadership check-ins on progress

JENNIFER HARTLEY:
Anything else before we close?

DR. ELENA KOVÁCS:
One thing: I know this is difficult and stressful for everyone. But I want to
say that I'm proud of how this team has responded.

We found a serious problem. We didn't hide it or minimize it. We're fixing it
and taking responsibility.

That's how ethical companies behave. Not every company would do this.

JENNIFER HARTLEY:
Thank you, Elena. I agree.

This is not the situation any of us wanted to be in. But I'm confident we'll
emerge from this as a stronger, more responsible company.

Meeting adjourned at 16:30.
